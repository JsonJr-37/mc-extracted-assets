# Minecraft Extracted Assets
This repo holds the Minecraft Assets for Resource Pack and Datapack devs. NOTE: These are not mine, and I am just hosting this for ease of use.

# Usage
I don't own these, so I cannot direct. But, check the EULA at the [Official Minecraft Website](https://minecraft.net/).

Also, don't forget to look at the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/). Helpful Links (probably): [Resource Pack Info](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Resource_pack#Directory_structure) [Datapack Info](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_pack#Folder_structure) [Pack Format](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pack_format)

Instructions:
1. Click the version zip you want to download
2. Look on the right on the bar for a download button that says "Download raw file"
3. Click, and it will start downloading
4. Once done, extract and enjoy

# How it is done
How I get the assets is go to [MCVersions.net](https://mcversions.net/), select the wanted version, download, convert the jar to a zip, (modifying the file extension) extract, and upload the data folder and assets folder.

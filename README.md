# Minecraft Extracted Assets
This repo holds the Minecraft Assets for R-Pack and Datapack devs. NOTE: These are not mine, and I am just hosting this for ease of use.

# Usage
I don't own these, so I cannot direct. But, check the EULA at the [Official Minecraft Website](https://minecraft.net/).

Here is a helpful website to download only 1 version / subfolder: [download-directory](https://download-directory.github.io/) 

Instructions:
1. Click the version folder you want to download
2. Copy the URL in the address bar
3. Go to [download-directory](https://download-directory.github.io/)
4. Paste the copied URL, and it should atomatically start downloading.

# How it is done
How I get the assets is go to [MCVersions.net](https://mcversions.net/), select the wanted version, download, convert the jar to a zip, (modifying the file extension) extract, and upload the data folder and assets folder.
